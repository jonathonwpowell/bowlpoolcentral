### THE DETAILS
All bowl games except the semifinals and finals are worth one point for a total of 38 points.  
The semifinals games (2) are worth 2 points for a total of 4  points.  
The finals game (1) is worth 4 points.  
Correctly pick both teams in the finals you receive 1 bonus point.  
Add it all up for a total of __47 Points__  
### TIEBREAKER
Total points scored by Duke, NCSU, Wake Forest and  in their bowl games. This total does not include points scored by their opponents, just by the adding the point totals of the 3 teams above.(Not including spreads)
### THE SPREAD 
Each game includes a spread, this is how much the favorite must beat the underdog in order to win.   Example: If NCSU is favored by 3.5 points they must beat their opponent by at least 4 points to cover the SPREAD and win the point for the game.
### PICKING THE FINAL TEAMS
Since teams will have to win their semifinals game to reach the finals it will be more difficult to pick the 2 teams playing in this game and therefore the winner. That is why we are awarding an extra bonus point for getting both finals teams correct.  And a whopping 4 points for picking the winner.
### PLEASE NOTE
You can choose a team to win it’s semi-final game with the spread, and choose the other team to be in the finals. For example if TCU and Navy were playing in the semifinals and Navy is a 10 point underdog,  but TCU wins by 7 points. You could choose Navy to win this game with the spread win (2 points) and also pick TCU to move on to the finals--which if you choose both finalists correctly would get you an extra 1 point.
